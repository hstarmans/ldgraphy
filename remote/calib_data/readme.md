centerspot.png
prism set so beam would not refract and continue along a straight line
this is believed to be the center

Subsequently, pixels were recorded using that the line length was set at 
4504 pixels. The center pixel is, half, which means 2252 and this should be close to centerspot.png.
Typically, one would expect that the center is at pixels_perfacet/2 but it is 6627 and nto 6250. So the start pixel in the slicer is 6627-2252 = 3998.
